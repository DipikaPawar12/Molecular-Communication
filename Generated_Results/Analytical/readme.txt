fig3: This graph represents the change in
      BER with respect to the Threshold 
      value.

fig7: This graph is for zero-bit memory 
      reciever for both the optimal and 
      sub-optimal method

fig8: It represents probability distribution
      wrt number of recieved particles. It 
      also represents 2 threshold values for
      optimal and sub-optimal approach

fig14:This graph is for one-bit memory 
      reciever for both the optimal and 
      sub-optimal method

fig16:This graph is for two-bit memory 
      reciever for both the optimal and 
      sub-optimal method

*Performance*:
zero-bit>one-bit>two-bit
