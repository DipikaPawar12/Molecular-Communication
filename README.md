## Introduction

---

This project is a part of the wireless communication(ECE311) course of our college. 
The project is about making an analysis of the article namely 'Molecular Communications: Model-Based and Data-Driven Receiver Design and Optimization'. The main focus was to study  three types memory based receivers by the model based and the data based approach. For the innovation part we have worked on comparison of the LSTM model and the data driven model with the conclusion that the performance of the LSTM model is better compared to simple data based model for molecular communication based system.

- Here we have two project reports, which contains system model explaination, formula derivation and result comparision
- Also [analysis.pdf](https://github.com/DipikaPawar12/Molecular-Communication/blob/main/analysis.pdf) contains hand-written derivations
- For the results we had used [matlab](https://github.com/DipikaPawar12/Molecular-Communication/tree/main/Generated_Results/Analytical) and [python](https://github.com/DipikaPawar12/Molecular-Communication/tree/main/Generated_Results/DataDrivenANN) respectively for system model and network model
- Apart from these, we had created a project video for more explaination
- Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkgotBWvhA&list=LL&index=17

## Tools
